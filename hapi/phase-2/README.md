####Theory

1. Learn on promise library like bluebird (or any other preferred promise library)
2. Learn mongoose and how to implement that in hapi.js app
3. Learn JWT (JSON web tokens) and redis.

####Practical

1. Replace cookie based authentication with JWT and store tokens in redis database (local)
2. Once point 1 is complete, move your redis database from local to cloud. (use a trial account )
3. Learn how to use npm 'hapi-next' and break your functions into small modules to impose SRP
4. Write test cases for your mongoose models.
